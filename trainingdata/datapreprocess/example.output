Even if we don’twrite posts, comment, or upload other content, we leave our traces by being silent observers. This leads toStatistapredictable results – according to, the amountof data generated globally is expected to surpass 180 zettabytes in 2025. On the one hand, having manyresources to make data-based decisions is brilliant. What’s a bit limiting: Most generated data isunstructured data, and such datasets have no predetermined model.James KeenanRead more about author.For better or for worse, by 2025, 80% of all data will be . And that’s the key reason we need to learn how to workaccording to IDC predictionsunstructured,with unstructured datasets.Stay in the loopSubscribeDealing with Unstructured DataWhy is it hard to work with unstructured data? Well, such datasets don’t comply with a prede ned format, making it hard to analyze or  nd use cases for direct usage. Yet, unstructured data canprovide valuable insights and help to formulatestrategies.data-drivenManually analyzing unstructured data is time-consuming and expensive; hence, such a process ismore prone to human error and bias. Plus, it’s not scalable, which is a big no-no for businesses focusing on growth. Luckily, there are ways to transform unstructured data into a feasible format.While it’s relatively easy to manage structured data using everyday tools like Excel, Google Sheets, , unstructured data management requires more advanced tools, complex andrelational databasesrules, Python libraries, and techniques to transform it into quanti able data.Steps to Structure Unstructured DataUnstructured data processing is more complex; however, the process can be less frustrating if youfollow some exact steps. They can differ depending on the initial goal of analysis, the desiredoutcome, the software, and other resources.1. Find Where to Store Your DataEverything starts with the question: Where to store the data? The choice is either public or in-house storage hardware. The latter offers complete control over data and its security; however, it requiresmore IT support, maintenance, and security infrastructure costs. In general, on-premise data storageStay in the loopSubscribesolutions are more compelling for highly regulated industries like  nance or health care.The public clouds, on the other hand, enable remote collaboration and are cost-effective and morescalable: If you need more space, you can upgrade the plan. Therefore, it’s an excellent option forstartups and small companies with limited IT resources, time, or funds to build internal storage systems.2. Clean Your DataBy its nature, unstructured data is messy and sometimes includes typos, HTML tags, punctuation,hashtags, special characters, banner ads, and whatnot. Thus, it’s necessary to perform data pre-processing, commonly referred to as “data cleaning,” before jumping on the actual structuring process. Data cleaning entails various methods, such as reducing noise, removing irrelevant data, andsplitting data into more understandable pieces. You can perform data cleaning with Excel, Python,and other programming languages or with special data cleaning tools.3. Categorize the Collected DataAnother step in the data organizing process is to de ne relationships between various units in the dataset. Sorting the entities into categories helps measure which data is essential for your analysis.You can classify your data based on content, context, or a user according to your needs. For example,if you’re scraping used vehicle sites, you might need to differentiate which elements are comments and which are technical information. If your datasets are incredibly complex, you’ll need aprofessional data scientist to help structure everything correctly. For non-complex datasets, you canclassify data using Python.4. Design a Pre-annotatorAfter classifying data, complete the annotation part. This process of labeling data helps machinesbetter understand the context and patterns behind the data to provide relevant results. Such aprocess can be handled by hand, making it time-consuming and fallible. You can automate thisprocess by designing a pre-annotator with the help of Python dictionaries.Setting a Dictionary and RulesPython dictionaries can also help you retrieve the required values from the dataset. Setting adictionary will create arrays of already grouped data units. In other words, dictionaries help youdevelop keys for data values. For example, when the keys are matched with particular values, theannotator can recognize that the mentioned word “Ford” is a car (in this case, “car” is a key, and “Ford”is a value). While creating a dictionary, you can add synonyms too, so that the annotator can structure data based on known words and their synonyms.Stay in the loopSubscribeTo avoid mistakes in the structuration process, de ne the rules to prevent random associations. Forexample, whenever the annotator spots the car name, it should identify the serial number next to it.Thus, an annotation tool should mark the number next to a vehicle’s name as its serial number.5. Sort Data with PythonAfter  nishing the previous step, you need to sort out and match certain pieces of information whileremoving irrelevant content. This can be done with the help of Python regular expressions –sequences of characters that can group and extract patterns in the text.Tokenize DataThe following process is to split a large chunk of text into words or sentences. You may use a Naturalinstall this Python libraryLanguage Toolkit (NLTK) to deal with it. For that, you need toand performword or sentence tokenization, depending on your preferences.Process Data Using Stemming and LemmatizationAnother step in natural language processing (NLP) coding is stemming and lemmatization. Simply put, they both shape words according to their root. The  rst one is simpler and faster – it just cutsdown the stem; for example, “cooking” becomes “cook.” Lemmatization is a bit slower and moresophisticated process. It composes the world’s in ected forms into a single entity for analysis. In thiscase, the word “went” would be grouped with “go” even though they don’t share the same root.Those two processes are not only part of natural language processing but machine learning as well.Therefore, stemming and lemmatization are the text pre-processing techniques that help analysis tools understand and process text data at scale, later transforming the results into valuable insights.6. Visualize the Received ResultsThe  nal and most important step in structuring data is convenient visualization. Concise datarepresentation helps transform mundane spreadsheets into charts, reports, or graphs. All this can bedone in Python using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others, depending on the databases and visualization preferences.Use Cases of Structuring DataNot sure how data structuring can be helpful for your business? Here are some ideas:Sentimental analysis: Collect data (like reviews and comments), structure it, and visualize it forStay in the loopSubscribeanalysis. It’s vital in e-commerce, where the competition is at its  nest and being one step ahead requires processing more data, which is mostly unstructured.Document clustering: Organize documents and retrieve and  lter information automatically. Inthe long term, it helps to make the search process faster, more e cient, and cost-effective.Information retrieval: Map documents to prevent the loss of important information.In a NutshellWorking with unstructured data is not easy; however, investing in it as early as possible is essential.Luckily, Python can be actively used during the process and help automate the integral parts.LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR COURSE SUBSCRIPTIONSShare on:DATAVERSITY.netTDAN.comStay in the loopSubscribeConferencesOnline ConferencesDATAVERSITY ResourcesEnterprise Data WorldEnterprise Data GovernanceOnlineDATAVERSITY TrainingData Governance &CenterInformation QualityData Architecture OnlineWhite PapersEnterprise Analytics OnlineProduct DemosWhat is…?CompanyNewslettersDATAVERSITYInformationEducationDATAVERSITY WeeklyWhy Train withData ConferencesDATAVERSITY EmailDATAVERSITYPreferencesTrade JournalAbout UsOnline TrainingAdvertise With UsUpcoming Live WebinarsContact UsBooksPress Room© 2011 – 2023 Dataversity Digital LLC | All Rights Reserved.Terms of ServiceCookies SettingsCA: Do Not Sell My Personal InformationPrivacy Policy---------------------------------------------------------------------

See some of the ways you can use it in Word -Generate a tailored resume for the job based on the job descriptionGenerate content for blog posts or articlesSummarise lengthy reports for youProvide suggestions for social media postsCreate templates for emails and proposalsHelp non-native speakers in translating in other languagesHow to Use ChatGPT in Microsoft WordIntegrating ChatGPT into MS Word has never been easier with the ChatGPT plugin (add-in). You can download the add-in using the link below. It is absolutely free and and can run on all the versions of Office Desktop and Office 365. Also there are no prerequisites for using this add-in.  DOWNLOAD ADD-INGet OpenAI API KeyFirst you need to sign up by visiting OpenAI website using this link - platform.openai.com. By using your existing Google or Microsoft account you can do it easily. Last step is to get secret API key to use OpenAI API. Copy your API key for future reference. API Key looks like the text belowsk-xxxxxxxxxSteps to install add-inMicrosoft blocks external add-in files and says the source of this file is untrusted. To make the file trusted, you need to follow the steps below.Go to the folder where the downloaded add-in file is located.Right-click the file and choose Properties from the menu.At the bottom of the General Tab, select the Unblock checkbox under security option and then click OkTo make the add-in to be available each time you launch MS Word, you can save it in the Startup folder. Follow the steps below.Go to File > Options > Advanced.Scroll down to General and click on File Locations.Click on Startup > Modify and then you have two options - Either you locate the folder where downloaded add-in file is stored. OR Instead of changing the Startup folder location, you can also paste the add-in in the existing Startup folder.
It is recommended to use the latter option. If you prefer first option, make sure to create a new folder and put the downloaded add-in file there and then navigate the location of Startup folder to this new folder. It is because if you use a folder for e.g. Download/Documents folder which may contain so many word files, it is likely MS Word would crash.How to use ChatGPT add-inFollow the steps below to use ChatGPT add-in for MS Word.Open a new or existing MS Word documentType the text you want to ask ChatGPTSelect the text you typed in the previous stepClick on ChatGPT Tab > AI WriterEnter your API KeyOutput will be generated and appeared in a few secondsOutput will be saved in a new word document in the same folder where your active word document is storedFile name of output file is output_mm-dd-yyyy_hr-min-sec.docxIf your active Word document is not saved in any location, it will prompt you to select the folder where you want to save the output file.Resume BuilderYou can generate resume with this add-in. It is important that you provide a clear and detailed prompt so that ChatGPT generates resume according to your requirements. Always be specific and try with multiple prompts for best outcome. See some of the examples below -Write a professional resume for a [Profile Name]. I have [N] years of experience. My past titles and companies were [Title, Company Name]. Include bullet points.Write a professional resume for a Data Scientist. I have 5 years of experience. My past titles and companies were Analyst, Barclays, Team Lead, JP Morgan. Include bullet points.Write a resume for a [Profile Name] based on this job description. [Add Job Description Here]Email WritingYou can ask ChatGPT Add-in to draft email for you. Whether you need to send a formal business email or a friendly message to a colleague or friend, ChatGPT can help you write a professional and well-drafted message. You just need to provide the purpose of email and some context and ChatGPT will generate a well-written email for you. You can also choose the tone of email.Write an email to manager about sick leave tomorrow. My Manager’s name is Dave. My name is Deep.Write an email to colleague about personal leave tomorrow. My colleague’s name is Joe. My name is Deep. Tone should be informal.It's also good to specify tone - formal / informal/ humorous.Summary WritingChatGPT Add-in can be used to summarize lengthy word document for you. For example you have a long document and you are asked to create summary based on it. It may be time consuming and boring to read the whole text and then write summary.Summarise the text below in bullet points - [PASTE TEXT HERE]How to Enable Conversation History?You can improve output by making ChatGPT remember previous conversation history. ChatGPT API does not recall previous conversations by default. It treats each API request as a new chat. This means that when it answers your current question, it does not remember your previous question.To enhance ChatGPT experience we have a feature called "Chat" in the plug-in. See the demo video below. In this example, we asked ChatGPT to make a resume by giving it some details about the job and previous work experience. The resume was generated accordingly. To make the CV better, we asked ChatGPT to add internship experience. If you notice, it remembered the previous instructions and included only the internship experience while keeping the rest of the resume the same.The Reset button starts a new Chat and removes prior conversation history. Use this button when you don't need chat history to generate output.How to style ChatGPT Output?You can style MS Word Document by adding the following lines to the end of the prompt you ask ChatGPTHighlight the headings in dark blue color.Write a resume for a Software Engineer. Highlight the headings in dark blue color.Include bullet points.Please format the text to be italic.Text should be in red colour.In the next section we will see the source code of this add-in. If you are not interested in knowing the source code, you can skip the next section. The add-in and VBA code serve the same purpose.The benefit of using add-in is that it opens automatically every time you open a new word document. Whereas MS Word Macro file is specific to a particular word document. You have to open the same macro file each time to access ChatGPT. Also the add-in performs formatting in the word document.VBA Code to run ChatGPT in MS WordYou can use the VBA Code below to run ChatGPT inside MS Word. Make sure to change API Key (highlighted in bold below)Sub chatGPT()    Dim request As Object    Dim text As String, response As String, API As String, api_key As String, DisplayText As String, error_result As String    Dim startPos As Long, status_code As Long    Dim prompt As String    Dim selectedText As Range    'API Info    API = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"    'API Key api_key = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"    If api_key = "" Then        MsgBox "Error: API key is blank!"

It ranges from 0 to 2. Increasing the value, such as 1.2, will result in a more random output, whereas decreasing the value, like 0.2, will yield a more focused output.Steps for troubleshooting errorsThe error The model: gpt-4 does not exist means you don't have access to GPT-4 API. You must join the waitlist to access it. Your subscription to ChatGPT Plus (paid version of ChatGPT) does not guarantee automatic access to the GPT-4 API, regardless of whether you have it or not.If you either mistakenly choose GPT-4 instead of GPT-3.5 or entered incorrect API Key, you can correct it by clicking the Update Key button to specify the correct Model Type and API Key. Once done, you can check it by clicking on the Check Key button.Sometimes, the ChatGPT API acts strangely and starts producing errors. If the add-in was working fine for you before but is now returning errors, I suggest trying again a few more times. If the issue persists, please report it.Refer the detailed guide about how to run ChatGPT in MS Excel and PowerPoint
